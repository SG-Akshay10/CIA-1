# Weight Optimisation of Neural Network using Genetic Algorithm

Weight optimization of a neural network using a genetic algorithm involves using the principles of evolution to find the optimal set of weights that minimizes the network's loss function. The genetic algorithm starts by generating a population of potential solutions, where each solution represents a set of weights for the neural network. The fitness of each solution is then evaluated by calculating the loss function for the corresponding network. The fittest individuals are selected to "breed" the next generation of solutions.

The breeding process involves crossover and mutation. Crossover involves selecting two parent solutions and combining their weights to create a new child solution. Mutation involves randomly modifying the weights of a solution to introduce new variations.

The newly generated population is then evaluated for fitness, and the process repeats until a satisfactory solution is found, or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

The genetic algorithm provides a powerful optimization technique that can be used to improve the accuracy and performance of neural networks.

# Weight Optimisation of Neural Network using Particle Swarm Optimization

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a popular metaheuristic optimization algorithm that can be used to optimize the weights of a neural network. PSO is based on the behavior of swarms in nature, where each individual particle adjusts its position based on its own experience and the experience of the best particle in the swarm.
